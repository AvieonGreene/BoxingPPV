# BoxingPPV
project for code louisville.

	For my project I have decided to make a Boxing PPV subscription site.
This website contains 3 plans US , International , and All plans included. After that there is a FAQ located underneath with questions about us they may want to ask and answers to the question. Then we have our form  for them to place their information and options of plans they want to choose. After that we have our Javascript message displaying the values in my array. That's just a nice message they will see after completing the form. While that's most of my page we have our navs that will lead them to our Home page , About us , and Contact page, these can be found at the top right of our page and the bottom center of our page. 
For my 3 features i have added to my website i first gave the nav links a transition animation when you hover over them to give it a cool effect. Second I added the javascript array with all of my contents showing up on my web page. And for my third feature I added the accordion box and it has all information from questions we believe they might have about our website. I have also added 3 media queries which are max width 768px  , max width 600px, and max width 314px.  
This project is nowhere near done but for our project this is what I have finished for you guys to grade. I will continue to work on this website and add better styling and make it look more professional but for a first website this will be okay for now. But last but not least to view this website you will have to open it with a live server in VS code.
